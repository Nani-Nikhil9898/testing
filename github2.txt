--------This is for cloning from repo to work (repo to local)------------

git clone https://github.com/Nani-Nikhil9898/testing.git

(Change something)

git add .
git commit -m "changes"
git push -u origin main

---------------------------------
git pull is used to maintain the consistency between remote repo & local repo.
So, when cloned a git repo, before pushing the changes, use git pull.
